# Project Papa Server

This is the server counterpart to the Project Papa project.

# Usage

To use, clone the repository and use cmake to build.

```
git clone https://github.com/project-papa/project-papa-server
cd project-papa-server
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will create a build directory and a `server` executable in the build
directory.
